This repository contains the API server code for the mesial (core/central) api for use throughout school web/server applications in addition to the school information dashboards. This api contains basic information such as current block, day schedule, upcoming events, etc.

This RESTful API is running on Python 3.8 using the [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). It is designed to be used in a variety of applications throughout the school. A frontend implementation can be seen in the RHS Information Dashboard frontend implementation [Github Repo Here](https://github.com/Riverbend-High-School/rhs-mesial-dashboard).
